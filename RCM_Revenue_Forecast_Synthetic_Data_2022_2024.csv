1,"The data (DATA) used for my sample model was generated with the help of LLM, given the following criteria:",,,,,,,
,"A baseline number of visits that fluctuates around 900 to 1,200 visits per month.",,,,,,,
,"Seasonal adjustments to reflect higher visits in certain months (e.g., flu season in fall/winter) and lower visits in summer (when elective procedures are typically down).",,,,,,,
,Random noise to introduce variability.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
2,"The payer mix (Private, Medicare, Medicaid) was randomized. The final percentages were normalized to sum to 100% for each month.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
3,Different reimbursement rates was assumed for each payer type:,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,Payer Type,Reimbursement Rate (Range),,,,,,
,Private,$150 to $180 per patient,,,,,,
,Medicare,$120 to $140 per patient,,,,,,
,Medicaid,$90 to $110 per patient,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
4,The monthly revenue per payer type was calculated using the formula:,,,,,,,
,Revenue=Patient Visits×Payer Mix×Reimbursement Rate×(1−Denial Rate),,,,,,,
