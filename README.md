# Revenue Modelling

Revenue forecast model using the 'Prophet' package in R.

## ðŸ“Š Data Generation Methodology

The dataset used for this sample model was generated with the help of LLM, based on the following criteria:

- Baseline patient visitsthat fluctuated around 900 to 1,200 visits per month.
- Seasonal adjustments to reflect higher visits in certain months (e.g., flu season in fall/winter) and lower visits in summer (when elective procedures are typically down).
- Random noise to introduce variability.

The payer mix (Private, Medicare, Medicaid) was randomized, and the final percentages were normalized to sum to 100% for each month.

Different reimbursement rates were assumed for each payer type:

| **Payer Type** | **Reimbursement Rate (Range)** |
|---------------|---------------------------------|
| Private       | $150 to $180 per patient        |
| Medicare      | $120 to $140 per patient        |
| Medicaid      | $90 to $110 per patient         |

The monthly revenue per payer type was calculated using the following formula:
```
Revenue = Patient_Visits * Payer_Mix * Reimbursement_Rate * (1 âˆ’ Denial_Rate)
```

## ðŸ“‹ Columns in the Dataset

- **Date**: Monthly date intervals from January 2022 to December 2024.
- **Patient_Visits**: The number of patient visits per month.
- **Private_Revenue**: Revenue generated from private insurance.
- **Medicare_Revenue**: Revenue generated from Medicare.
- **Medicaid_Revenue**: Revenue generated from Medicaid.
- **Claims_Denial_Rate**: Percentage of denied claims each month.
- **Total_Revenue**: The total monthly revenue from all payer sources.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Steps in the R Markdown File

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset was read from `RCM_Revenue_Forecast_Synthetic_Data_2022_2024.csv`.
2. **Prophet Model**: A revenue forecast was built using the Prophet package.
3. **Table Output**: Forecasted revenue values for each month of 2025 were displayed.
4. **Forecast Visualization**: Historical revenue (2022-2024) and forecasted revenue for 2025 were plotted.

## ðŸ“Š Forecast Insights

The forecasted revenue for 2025 shows a continuation of the historical trends observed from 2022 to 2024. The model accounts for seasonality and quarterly trends. The forecast could help inform hospital resource allocation and budgeting.

## ðŸ”¬ Future Techniques to Practice with This Data

In addition to the Prophet model, additional techniques that could be practiced in future with this dataset:

- **ETS (Error, Trend, Seasonality)**: Exponential smoothing technique for time series forecasting.
- **Random Forest for Time Series**: Using machine learning algorithms to capture non-linear patterns in the data.
